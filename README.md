# 11-Note-Taker

  ## Description

  The purpose of this project was to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
  
  In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria of the project:

  * Opening the Note Taker presents a landing page with a link to the notes page
  * The notes page displays a list of existing notes on the left column and an empty field to enter a new note title/text on the right column
  * Entering a new note title/text will bring up a save icon that will save the note upon click and display it on the list of existing notes
  * Clicking an existing note will bring up the note on the right column
  * Clicking on the write icon will present empty fields for a new note title/text
